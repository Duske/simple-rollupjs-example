# Simple rollup bundling including banner

This repository shows how a simple ES2015 module bundling can be done with rollup.js.
Additionally this features a JS banner at top of the bundled file.

## Usage
Compile and bundle JS: `gulp`

Execute bundles JS: `npm start`

## Note
Please note that this is a very simple and naive setup for rollup.js. In a real world example you would probably use
[rollup's plugins](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Plugins) for bundling etc.
